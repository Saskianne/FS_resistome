# FS_resistome

Sunwoo Lee, 1-subject biology master
at FD3, RUMS, GEOMAR, KIEL
Freshwater sponge symbiont resistome, along the Schwentine (M.Sc. Project)

# Research Internship (3.2-20.03.2025)
### Goals:
1. Establishment of bioinformatic workflow for the resistome analysis from the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data of freshwater sponge microbial symbiont
    1.1. Available data acquisition about freshwater sponge symbiont and their ARGs
    1.2. Pattern recognition: location-, species-specific microbiome/resistome
2. Establishment of PCR and qPCR protocol for sponge symbiont ARGs as a screening and validation method
    2.1. Primer sets for the sample screening and observation 
    2.2. Culture-based identification of symbionts and their ARGs
    2.3. Preparation for the sampling and metagenome sequencing

### Relevant data/files:
1. FastqDump: information about the downloaded raw sequencing data or MAG data
2. Assembly: raw reads to contigs for Illumina and PacBio raw reads (in separated folders)
3. & 4. MAG: contigs to MAG assembly(3), QC and few other basic information about the MAGs (4)
5. ARG_analysis: downstream analysis for ARG detection in MAGs

- Primer: few information about qPCR experiments
- Juttas_strains: ARG analysis on the genomes of Jutta's AMR strains

- What_today.ipynb: everyday progress during the internship (and also Master's thesis)
- setup.ipynb: information about the virtual environment settings 
- link_tree.md/ipynb: Relevant links and information about the pipelines and helpful links for the project
- slurm_info.ipynb: some useful information and command for work with slurm on nesh-HPC system

Hyper links are going to be added
