# FS_resistome
Freshwater sponge symbiont resistome, along the Schwentine (M.Sc. Project)

# Research Internship (3.2-20.03.2025)
Goals:
1. Establishment of bioinformatic workflow for the resistome analysis from the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data of freshwater sponge microbial symbiont
    1.1. Available data acquisition about freshwater sponge symbiont and their ARGs
    1.2. Pattern recognition: location-, species-specific microbiome/resistome
2. Establishment of PCR and qPCR protocol for sponge symbiont ARGs as a screening and validation method
    2.1. Primer sets for the sample screening and observation 
    2.2. Culture-based identification of symbionts and their ARGs
    2.3. Preparation for the sampling and metagenome sequencing
